# Given an array arr[] of size N, the task is to rotate the array by d position to the left.

# Input:  arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}, d = 2
# Output: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 1, 2
# Explanation: If the array is rotated by 1 position to the left, 
# it becomes {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 1}.
# When it is rotated further by 1 position,
# it becomes: {3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 1, 2}

# Function to reverse arr[] from index start to end
def reverseArray(arr, start, end):
    while (start < end):
        temp = arr[start]
        arr[start] = arr[end]
        arr[end] = temp
        start += 1
        end = end-1
  
# Function to left rotate arr[] of size n by d
  
  
def leftRotate(arr, d):
  
    if d == 0:
        return
    n = len(arr)
    # in case the rotating factor is
    # greater than array length
    d = d % n
    reverseArray(arr, 0, d-1)
    reverseArray(arr, d, n-1)
    reverseArray(arr, 0, n-1)
  
# Function to print an array
  
  
def printArray(arr):
    for i in range(0, len(arr)):
        print (arr[i],end=' ')
  
  
# Driver function to test above functions
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
n = len(arr)
d = 2
  
leftRotate(arr, d)  # Rotate array by 2
